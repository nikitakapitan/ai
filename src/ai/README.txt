The py files in this library are written by me from scratch for learning purposes only:

network.py [Main file] - neural network class definition with:
- network initialization
- forward pass (aka predict)
- learning engine (aka fit)
- backpropagation

activation_function.py - definition of sigmoid, sigmoid_prime etc

gradient.py - additional file with analytical and numerical gradiend analysis

regnetwork.py - Inherited network class with regularization

Target_functions.py - definition of QuadraticCost, CrossEntropyCost and their derivatives.

neuron.py (depricated, not used) - class definition of a single neuron.
