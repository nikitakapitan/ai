Welcome my new AI guest, 

I am Nick, mathematician, python programmer and AI enthousiast.

This small python module aims to group my AI experience, but also different pipelines for Kaggle competition.

<h1> GitHub structure </h1>

This GutHub mainly contains interactive notebooks (ai/notebooks):
- [Demo] DL concepts : vizualisation of different DL concepts like overfiting, regression, regularization etc.
- DLSchool           : my bachelor projects on DL
- Kaggle             : my kaggle projects (in progress)

Here are some examples of my AI projects.

<h2> 1. Where it all starts : mnist classification </h2>

One day, to understand how do pytorch and other libraries work, I created empty file network.py.
During 1 month, I wrote my first NN and achivied 96.4% test accuracy on MNIST data.

Following [Ian Goodfellow](https://www.google.fr/books/edition/Deep_Learning/omivDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), I wrote from scratch the basic neural network for MNIST classification to better understand the concepts like:
- NN architecture and it's initialization
- forward pass (aka predict) and its computational graph
- learning engine (aka fit) 
- generalized backpropogation engine
